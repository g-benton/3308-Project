SNIPPET 1 ***************************************************************
More descriptive variable/function names. Functions and variable names should
   let the user know exactly what they are doing and what is being stored
   in the variable.
line 17: ; shouldn't be used in python to do multiple function initializations
   on the same line
line 19: don't hard code in a file path, should be passed in as a command line
   argument
line 20: pointless dictionary of tuples, should just be a list.
line 29: the if statement should be a for loop through all the files
line 43: The print statement should not be commented out
line 44: self.i was never set because the ci function in which it is declared
   and set was never called in the r function

SNIPPET 2 ***************************************************************
line 21: self.path needs to be defined
line 29: the 'if json' at the end is redundant
line 30: the new list will stop at the 'if not json'. Should check if the json files
   are in self.before or state_change.
line 54: need if __name__ == '__main__':
line 59: there is no way to exit from the while loop, it will go on forever

SNIPPET 3 ***************************************************************
There should be more comments to explain what is happening in the code.
line 18: before gets overridden on line 22.
line 21: the path should be read in as a command line argument
line 22: not using the full functions of a dictionary (key, value), so can just
   be a list.
line 36: iterates over just the keys, not the values
