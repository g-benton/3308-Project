1,,"3 Ingredient Peanut  Butter & Honey Cereal Bars","Line an 8 x 8 inch square pan with parchment.

Combine peanut butter & honey in a large saucepan and set over medium heat. Heat until mixture just starts to simmer, about 2-3 minutes, stirring. Remove from heat and stir until mixture is well-combined.

Stir in cereal until evenly coated. Pour mixture into prepared pan, cover with parchment, and press firmly. (Edited to add: A pastry roller will help to firmly and evenly pack down the mixture so the bars hold their shape). Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Cut into bars. Store individually wrapped in the refrigerator."
2,NULL,"Easy Guacamole","Mix the onion and jalapeño together with the salt and the juice of 1 lime. Let sit for a few minutes.
Meanwhile, roughly mash the avocados.
Mix the onion and jalapeño into the avocados and garnish with cilantro, to your taste.
Serve with tortilla chips or on top of your favorite taco or other Mexican dish."
3,NULL,"Baked Summer Squash","Preheat the oven to 350°F. Remove the stem ends and slice the squash cross-wise in 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Toss with the olive oil.

In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Arrange the squash rounds in a 9x12-inch rectangular baking dish, or 10-inch pie plate. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over.

Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake another five minutes until the top is bubbling and crispy."
4,NULL,"Lemon-Honey Glazed Carrots","Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the carrots, herbs and salt. Stir the carrots around to coat them evenly in the oil and herbs. Cover the pan and let them cook, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, or until fork tender.
Whisk the honey and lemon juice in a small bowl. Once the carrots are fork tender, add the lemon honey to the pan and stir to coat the carrots. Transfer to a bowl and serve."
5,,"Best Grilled Chicken","In a large bowl drizzle the chicken with some of the olive oil and make sure to coat it nicely.
Sprinkle the spice mix generously all over the chicken tenders.
Using your hands make sure to rub it all over. Allow it to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes to take off the chill. That will assure your chicken won't stick to the pan and it will cook through quickly.
Meanwhile heat up a cast iron grill pan over medium high flame.
Add the chicken tenderloin and grill 1-2 minutes per side until nice golden brown grill marks form and the chicken is cooked through.
Transfer to a plate and squeeze some lemon juice over the top if desired.
Serve drizzled with the best chimichurri sauce on top."
6,NULL,"Baked Parmesan Asparagus Fries","Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper.
Place flour on one large plate. On a second plate combine Panko crumbs, cheese, onion powder, parsley flakes, salt and black pepper.
Scramble eggs and water in a large bowl.
Dip each asparagus spear in the flour, then the egg and then coat with Panko crumb cheese mixture.
Place asparagus on baking pan and bake for 20 minutes."
